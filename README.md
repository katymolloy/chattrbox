# Chattrbox
## A browser based messaging application

### Description
Chattrbox is a real-time web application for messaging friends. <br /> MongoDB is used for the database, Express.js and Node.js for the server, and React for the front end (MERN stack). 
Additionally, socket.io will be used to enable the real-time messaging, and scss is used for styling.
<br />
I specifically chose MongoDB over Google's Firestore as I've never worked with it before and hope to learn more through this project.
